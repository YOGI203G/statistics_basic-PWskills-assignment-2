    "The median is the middle value in the dataset, such that half of the values are greater than or equal to the median, and the other half are less than or equal to the median. The median is less sensitive to outliers than the mean and is a better measure of central tendency for skewed distributions.\n",

The variance of Dataset 1 is 62.5, and the standard deviation is 7.91, while the variance of Dataset 2 is 200 and the standard deviation is 14.14, again indicating that the scores in Dataset 2 are more spread out.
